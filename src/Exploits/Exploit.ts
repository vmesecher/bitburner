/*
The game cannot block every possible exploits. Specially since one of them is
that you can just edit your save file and that's impragmatic to prevent.

So instead we have source file minus 1. It is not obtained by destroying a
BitNode but instead it is awarded when the player finds innovative ways to break
the game, this serves 2 purpose, [one] the developpers don't have to spend time
trying to implement anti-cheat measures and [two] finding ways to break a
hacking game is very much in the spirit of the game.
Source-File minus 1 is extremely weak because it can be fully level up quickly.
