        Carry out operations for the Bladeburner division. Failing an operation
        will reduce your Bladeburner rank. It will also cause you to lose HP,
        which can lead to hospitalization. In general, operations are harder and
        more punishing than contracts, but are also more rewarding.
        <br />
        <br />
        Operations can affect the chaos level and Synthoid population of your
        current city. The exact effects vary between different Operations.
        <br />
        <br />
        For operations, you can use a team. You must first recruit team members.
        Having a larger team will improves your chances of success.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can unlock higher-level operations by successfully completing them.
        Higher-level operations are more difficult, but grant more rank and
        experience.
