        Complete contracts in order to increase your Bladeburner rank and earn
        money. Failing a contract will cause you to lose HP, which can lead to
        hospitalization.

        <br />
        You can unlock higher-level contracts by successfully completing them.
        Higher-level contracts are more difficult, but grant more rank,
        experience, and money.
