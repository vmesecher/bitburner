        This page is used to manage your gang members and get an overview of
        your gang's stats.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a gang member is not earning much money or respect, the task that you
        have assigned to that member might be too difficult. Consider training
        that member's stats or choosing an easier task. The tasks closer to the
        top of the dropdown list are generally easier. Alternatively, the gang
        member's low production might be due to the fact that your wanted level
        is too high. Consider assigning a few members to the '
        {props.gang.isHackingGang ? "Ethical Hacking" : "Vigilante Justice"}'
        task to lower your wanted level.

        Installing Augmentations does NOT reset your progress with your Gang.
        Furthermore, after installing Augmentations, you will automatically be a
        member of whatever Faction you created your gang with.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can also manage your gang programmatically through Netscript using
        the Gang API
